  { domain: "skineffects", q: "What dose to the fetus could result in spontaneous abortion?", a: "Approximately 50 rads (0.5 Gy) during early pregnancy. During the pre-implantation period (0–2 weeks), this follows the 'all-or-none' rule — the embryo either survives normally or is aborted.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "skineffects", q: "At what dose have deleterious effects been demonstrated in animal embryo experiments?", a: "As little as 10 rads (0.1 Gy). Effects increase significantly at 15+ rads. This is well below the human fetal dose limit of 0.5 rem (5 mSv) total pregnancy.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "skineffects", q: "What are the 10-day rule and 14-day rule for scheduling x-ray exams on women of childbearing age?", a: "10-day rule (ICRP): schedule abdominal x-rays within 10 days after onset of menses (when pregnancy is unlikely). 14-day rule (NCRP): similar but allows 14 days. Current recommendation: properly indicated exams need not be postponed regardless of menstrual timing, but ask about pregnancy status.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "skineffects", q: "Is interruption of pregnancy ever justified due to diagnostic x-ray exposure?", a: "No. The exposure levels from diagnostic radiology are far below the threshold for deterministic fetal effects. Termination of pregnancy is never justified on the basis of diagnostic x-ray exposure alone.", difficulty: 1 },
  { domain: "skineffects", q: "What are the specific radiation effects on the gonads?", a: "Male: spermatogonia drastically depleted by ~50 rads; temporary sterility at ~30 rads (spermatogonia can regenerate so sterility is temporary). Female: oocytes cannot be replaced — ovarian damage from radiation is permanent and irreversible.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "skineffects", q: "What dose threshold causes radiation-induced cataracts?", a: "Approximately several hundred rads (750 mGy or more) of acute dose for x-rays in the diagnostic range. Cataracts are the ONLY disease directly linked to long-term low-level radiation exposure as a deterministic effect.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "skineffects", q: "What are the specific fetal effects during organogenesis (weeks 3–8)?", a: "Morphological defects and congenital malformations — birth defects of organ systems forming at the time of exposure. This is the period of maximum sensitivity to teratogenic effects (structural abnormalities).", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "skineffects", q: "What are the specific fetal effects during the fetal growth period (9 weeks to birth)?", a: "CNS effects: microcephaly (small head), intellectual disability/mental retardation, impaired learning patterns. Also: growth retardation, reduced birth weight. The brain is the most sensitive organ during this period.", difficulty: 2 },

  // ── QA & IMAGE QUALITY (expanded) ─────────────────────────────

  { domain: "qa", q: "What are the four major steps of a QA program?", a: "(1) Acceptance testing of new/modified equipment. (2) Establishment of baseline performance levels.

  { domain: "qa", q: "How often must a qualified physicist review fluoroscopy equipment in California?", a: "Annually for equipment with automatic exposure control. Every 3 years (triennially) for equipment without automatic exposure control.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "qa", q: "What output rate increase triggers an investigation?", a: "A 25% increase over the calibrated output rate requires investigation and correction. If the calibrated output exceeds 4.0 R/min, testing must confirm the 5 R/min regulatory ceiling is not exceeded.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "qa", q: "What is the difference between high contrast resolution and low contrast resolution testing?", a: "High contrast resolution: tests ability to reproduce thin lines/spaces using copper mesh or resolution patterns (at 50–60 kVp). Measures spatial detail. Low contrast resolution: tests ability to resolve large objects that differ slightly in radiopacity using aluminum plates with drilled holes. Measures tissue differentiation ability.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "qa", q: "What factors affect spatial resolution in fluoroscopy? (list at least 4)", a: "Focal spot size, imaging geometry (magnification, source-to-image distance), optical coupling system, image intensifier characteristics, video camera properties, TV monitor resolution, and patient motion.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "qa", q: "What QC tests must be performed after repair or replacement of a major component?", a: "Collimation, ABC, AGC, resolution, phototimer, timer, mAs, kVp, dose rates, focal spot, and HVL must ALL be tested before the equipment is used on human patients.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "qa", q: "What is the kVp accuracy tolerance?", a: "+/- 5% of the set value (or +/- 2 kVp in the 60–100 kVp range, whichever is greater).", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "qa", q: "What is the acceptance criterion for mAs linearity?", a: "Ratios of exposure to mAs at any two consecutive tube current settings shall not differ by more than 0.10 times their sum. Ensures consistent output across mA stations.", difficulty: 3 },

  { domain: "qa", q: "What are typical fluoroscopic exposure rates by II mode?", a: "6-inch mode with grid: 2–3 R/min. 9-inch mode without grid: 1.5–2.5 R/min. ABC typically set at 80–90 kVp. Systems with a grid produce 1.5–2× higher rates. Room-to-room differences >25% should be investigated.", difficulty: 3 },
  { domain: "qa", q: "List the minimum QC test equipment that should be in a QA program.", a: "Penetrometer (aluminum step wedge), homogeneous phantom, stopwatch, densitometer, sensitometer, wire mesh contact test tool, thermometer (no mercury or alcohol allowed), calibrated dosimeter, and aluminum filters for HVL testing.", difficulty: 3 },

  // ── CROSS-CUTTING / VISUAL PHYSIOLOGY / MONITORING ────────────

  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is the difference between rods and cones in visual physiology, and why does it matter for fluoroscopy?", a: "Rods: scotopic (dim light) vision, peripheral, detect gray tones only. Cones: photopic (bright light) vision, central/fovea, detect color and fine detail. Photopic acuity is 10× greater than scotopic. Modern image-intensified fluoroscopy uses photopic (cone) vision because the monitor is bright. Room lighting should be dim but not dark.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is the image integration time of the human eye?", a: "0.2 seconds. Prolonged observation of a dim fluoroscopic image will NOT improve perceived brightness or detail. If the image is too dim, the only solution is to increase exposure or use image intensification.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is the optimal viewing distance for a fluoroscopic monitor?", a: "12–15 inches (30–38 cm) for conventional monitors. This distance optimizes the eye's ability to resolve image detail.", difficulty: 1 },
  { domain: "radprotection", q: "What are the three types of personnel monitoring devices and how do their accuracies compare?", a: "Film badge: sensitive 10 mrad – 700 rads, accuracy +/- 25%, provides permanent record on developed film. TLD (thermoluminescent dosimeter): accuracy +/- 9%, reusable, better low-dose sensitivity. Pocket ionization chamber (dosimeter): immediate readout, limited range, no permanent record. TLD is the most accurate.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "radprotection", q: "What is the quality factor (Q) for diagnostic x-rays, and what does it mean?", a: "Q = 1 for x-rays, gamma rays, and beta radiation. This means 1 rad = 1 rem for diagnostic x-rays (rem = rad × Q). Quality factor accounts for the relative biological effectiveness of different radiation types. Neutrons and alpha particles have higher Q values.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "radprotection", q: "What are the three types of gonad shields?", a: "Flat contact shield: placed directly on patient, simple but may not conform well. Shaped contact shield: molded to anatomy, acceptable for some fluoroscopic procedures. Shadow shield: suspended from the tube housing, casts a 'shadow' over gonads. For fluoroscopy, only shaped contact shields are practical; flat and shadow types are generally not suitable.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "radprotection", q: "Which diagnostic x-ray examinations produce the highest bone marrow doses?", a: "Barium enema, upper GI series, and abdominal angiography produce the highest bone marrow doses. Bone marrow dose is the most reasonable somatic dose indicator because marrow is widely distributed and highly radiosensitive.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "radprotection", q: "Calculate: A fluoroscopist stands at 100 mrad/hr for 42 minutes. What is the total exposure?", a: "100 mrad/hr × (42/60 hr) = 100 × 0.7 = 70 mrad.
