Provide discharge instructions including signs/symptoms requiring emergency care.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "patientcare", q: "What are common considerations for geriatric patients undergoing fluoroscopy?", a: "Impaired renal function (adjust contrast volume, pre-hydrate), increased fall risk (assist with transfers), hearing/vision impairment (clear communication), fragile veins (careful IV access), polypharmacy (drug interactions with sedation), hypothermia risk (keep warm), and cognitive impairment (may need caregiver present for consent).", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "patientcare", q: "What is the difference between anaphylactoid and true anaphylactic reactions to contrast?", a: "Anaphylactoid (most contrast reactions): non-IgE-mediated, direct mast cell activation, can occur on first exposure, severity is unpredictable. True anaphylactic: IgE-mediated, requires prior sensitization, typical allergic cascade. Treatment is the same for both. Prior reaction increases future risk from 1–2% to 17–35%.", difficulty: 3 },

Complete an incident report per institutional policy.", difficulty: 1 },
  { domain: "patientcare", q: "How should a patient with a known shellfish allergy be managed for iodinated contrast procedures?", a: "Shellfish allergy does NOT specifically increase iodinated contrast reaction risk — the allergen in shellfish is tropomyosin, not iodine.

  // ── EQUIPMENT & PHYSICS (expansion) ──────────────────────────

  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is the anode heel effect?", a: "X-ray intensity is greater on the cathode side of the beam than the anode side. Caused by self-absorption of x-rays within the anode target. The thicker body part should be positioned toward the cathode side for more uniform exposure.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "How does magnification mode work in an image intensifier?", a: "Voltage on the electrostatic focusing lenses is adjusted to focus electrons from a smaller area of the input phosphor onto the full output phosphor. Results in: larger image of a smaller anatomical area, improved resolution, but increased patient dose (ABC compensates for reduced brightness).", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is the space charge effect?", a: "At low kVp, the electron cloud around the cathode filament repels additional electrons from leaving the filament, limiting tube current. The tube current becomes independent of mA station and depends only on kVp. This is called space-charge-limited operation.", difficulty: 3 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is tube loading and how is it limited?", a: "Tube loading is the amount of heat deposited in the anode per exposure. Limited by: anode heat capacity (measured in heat units, HU), cooling rate, and focal spot size. Exceeding the tube rating can crack the anode or damage the tube housing.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "How do you calculate heat units (HU) for single-phase, three-phase, and high-frequency generators?", a: "Single-phase: HU = kVp × mA × time. Three-phase: HU = kVp × mA × time × 1.35. High-frequency: HU = kVp × mA × time × 1.40. Three-phase and HF generators deposit more heat because their waveforms deliver more average power.", difficulty: 3 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is the purpose of the added filtration in a fluoroscopy unit?", a: "Added filtration (usually aluminum, sometimes copper or aluminum + copper) removes low-energy photons that would increase patient skin dose without contributing to the image. Hardens the beam. Total filtration must meet minimum HVL requirements.", difficulty: 1 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is the inverse square law?", a: "Radiation intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source: I₁/I₂ = (d₂)²/(d₁)². Double the distance → 1/4 the intensity. This is the most important principle for operator protection.", difficulty: 1 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "How does the ABC system respond to patient thickness changes during fluoroscopy?", a: "When patient thickness increases, fewer x-rays reach the detector, image darkens. ABC responds by increasing kVp (first), then mA, to restore brightness. When thickness decreases, ABC reduces technique. Goal: maintain consistent image brightness automatically.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is the difference between CsI (cesium iodide) and gadolinium oxysulfide scintillators?", a: "CsI: needle-shaped crystals that act as light guides, reducing lateral light spread → better spatial resolution.

  { domain: "equipment", q: "What happens to image quality as you increase frame rate in pulsed fluoroscopy?", a: "Higher frame rate → smoother motion (less temporal blur), but higher patient dose (more pulses per second).

  { domain: "equipment", q: "Explain the difference between continuous fluoroscopy and pulsed fluoroscopy.", a: "Continuous: x-ray beam is always on during exposure, higher dose. Pulsed: x-ray beam fires in short bursts (pulses) with gaps between them. Pulsed fluoro reduces dose significantly — 15 pps pulsed delivers roughly half the dose of continuous 30 fps with comparable image quality for most procedures.", difficulty: 1 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "What are the typical focal spot sizes used in fluoroscopy?", a: "Small focal spot: 0.3–0.6 mm for fluoroscopy mode (better resolution, lower heat capacity). Large focal spot: 1.0–1.2 mm for acquisition/spot films (handles higher mA for short exposures). Most systems automatically select focal spot based on the mode.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is beam hardening and how does it affect the image?", a: "As the x-ray beam passes through tissue, low-energy photons are preferentially absorbed, shifting the average beam energy higher (harder). Effect: cupping artifact in CT, slightly reduced contrast in fluoro. Filtration intentionally pre-hardens the beam to reduce skin dose.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is the function of the anti-scatter grid in fluoroscopy?", a: "Absorbs scatter radiation before it reaches the detector, improving image contrast. Made of lead strips with aluminum or carbon fiber interspaces. Higher grid ratio (e.g., 12:1) absorbs more scatter but requires higher technique (dose). Removing the grid reduces dose ~50% but lowers contrast.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is the relationship between SID and magnification?", a: "Magnification = SID / SOD. Greater SID with same SOD → less magnification → more uniform geometry → less penumbra. In fluoroscopy, SID is typically fixed by the C-arm geometry. Maximizing SID reduces geometric unsharpness.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is penumbra and how is it minimized?", a: "Penumbra (geometric unsharpness) is the blurry edge around an object's shadow caused by the finite size of the focal spot.

  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is the dual energy subtraction technique?", a: "Two images acquired at different kVp values.

  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is the Bucky slot cover in fluoroscopy?", a: "A lead-equivalent shield that covers the slot below the table where the Bucky tray slides in.

  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is the difference between under-table and over-table x-ray tube configurations?", a: "Under-table: tube below the patient, detector above — most common for GI fluoroscopy.

  { domain: "digital", q: "What is dead pixel correction?", a: "Bad or dead pixels (DELs that give consistently wrong values) are identified during calibration and their values are replaced by interpolation from neighboring pixels. If too many pixels die in a cluster, image quality degrades and the panel needs replacement.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "digital", q: "How does recursive filtering (temporal averaging) work?", a: "Each displayed frame is a weighted average of the current frame and previous frames: Output = α × Current + (1-α) × Previous. Reduces quantum noise but adds motion lag. The weighting factor α controls the trade-off: higher α → less noise reduction, less lag.", difficulty: 3 },
  { domain: "digital", q: "What is the Nyquist frequency and why does it matter?", a: "The Nyquist frequency is the maximum spatial frequency that can be faithfully reproduced by a digital system: f_Nyquist = 1 / (2 × pixel pitch).

  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is the glass envelope and why is it necessary?", a: "The x-ray tube components (cathode and anode) are enclosed in a glass (or metal/ceramic) envelope that maintains a high vacuum. The vacuum is essential because air molecules would interact with the electron stream, absorbing electrons and preventing them from reaching the target.", difficulty: 1 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is the effect of kVp on image contrast?", a: "Higher kVp → more penetrating beam → fewer photons absorbed differentially → lower subject contrast (image appears more gray). Lower kVp → more differential absorption → higher contrast (more black and white). Fluoroscopy typically uses 75–120 kVp depending on body part.", difficulty: 1 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is the effect of mA on image quality?", a: "Higher mA → more photons → less quantum mottle (noise) → better signal-to-noise ratio. mA does NOT affect contrast or spatial resolution.

  { domain: "equipment", q: "What happens to patient dose when switching from 9-inch to 6-inch magnification mode on an II?", a: "Dose increases approximately 2–4× because the ABC compensates for the reduced number of x-rays reaching the smaller active area. The smaller input area collects fewer x-rays → image is dimmer → ABC increases technique. The exact increase depends on the system design.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "What are the requirements for the fluoroscopy foot switch (dead-man switch)?", a: "Must require continuous pressure to activate fluoroscopy — releasing the switch immediately stops the x-ray beam.

  { domain: "digital", q: "How does the automatic exposure rate control in a flat panel system differ from an II system?", a: "FPD system: measures the digital signal directly from the detector pixels (histogram analysis) and adjusts kVp/mA to maintain target pixel values. II system: measures light output from the output phosphor using a photomultiplier tube. FPD feedback is more precise because it samples the actual image data.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "digital", q: "What is frame rate in fluoroscopy?", a: "The number of images acquired per second. Standard: 30 fps (US TV standard). Pulsed fluoroscopy: 1, 3, 7.5, 15, or 30 pulses per second. Cardiac cine: 15–60 fps. Higher frame rates → smoother motion but higher dose.

  { domain: "radprotection", q: "What is the wrap-around lead apron and why is it recommended?", a: "A lead apron that provides full 360-degree coverage (front AND back) rather than front-only.

Each has different onset timing.", difficulty: 3 },
  { domain: "radbio", q: "Which blood cell counts change first after acute whole-body irradiation?", a: "Lymphocytes decrease first (within hours — they undergo interphase apoptosis).

Lymphocyte count at 48 hours is the best early predictor of dose.", difficulty: 3 },
  { domain: "radbio", q: "What is the difference between relative risk and absolute risk models?", a: "Relative risk model: radiation increases cancer risk by a multiplication factor above the natural rate (risk stays proportional to age-specific baseline).

  { domain: "skineffects", q: "What is the specific absorption rate in fluoroscopy, and why does entrance vs exit dose matter?", a: "The entrance (skin) dose is always MUCH higher than the exit dose because x-rays are exponentially attenuated through the body.

  { domain: "radprotection", q: "What is the dose rate at the tabletop during normal fluoroscopy?", a: "Maximum: 5 R/min (without automatic brightness control) or 10 R/min (with ABC) per federal regulations. California limit: same. High-level mode: up to 20 R/min. Typical clinical dose rates: 2–5 R/min depending on patient size and exam type. ABC optimizes dose rate automatically.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "radprotection", q: "What is the annual dose a typical interventional fluoroscopist receives?", a: "Without proper protection: 10–50 mSv/year (approaching or exceeding the annual limit). With proper protection (lead apron, glasses, ceiling shield, good technique): 1–5 mSv/year. High-volume operators may receive 5–15 mSv/year even with protection. Eye dose can be 5–10× body dose without lead glasses.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "doselimits", q: "What is the concept of 'dose constraint'?", a: "A prospective dose limit set BELOW the regulatory limit to ensure ALARA is maintained. Institutions set investigation levels (dose constraints) that trigger review when exceeded. Example: if the annual limit is 50 mSv, an institution might set a constraint of 10 mSv — triggering investigation at 20% of the limit.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "doselimits", q: "What is the 'action level' concept in a QA program?", a: "A pre-defined threshold that triggers corrective action. Example: if output rate exceeds 25% above the calibrated baseline, the equipment must be investigated and recalibrated before further patient use. Action levels provide objective criteria for deciding when equipment performance is unacceptable.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "doselimits", q: "What are diagnostic reference levels (DRLs)?", a: "Benchmark dose values for typical fluoroscopic procedures, set at the 75th percentile of national dose surveys. If a facility consistently exceeds the DRL, they should investigate their technique and equipment. DRLs are NOT dose limits — they are quality improvement tools. Examples: PKA values for specific procedure types.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "radbio", q: "What is genomic instability and its relevance to radiation?", a: "Radiation can cause persistent genetic instability in surviving cells and their descendants — leading to delayed mutations, chromosomal aberrations, and cell death generations after the original exposure. This may explain some aspects of radiation-induced carcinogenesis that do not fit simple direct-damage models.", difficulty: 3 },
  { domain: "radbio", q: "What evidence comes from the Life Span Study (LSS) of atomic bomb survivors?", a: "The most important source of human radiation risk data. Key findings: increased cancer risk proportional to dose (supports LNT), latent periods for different cancer types, age-at-exposure modifiers (children more sensitive), excess relative risk decreases with time since exposure, and solid evidence for cancer induction but NOT for genetic effects in offspring.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "radbio", q: "What is the effective dose of common fluoroscopic procedures?", a: "Barium swallow: 1.5 mSv. Upper GI: 3 mSv. Barium enema: 7 mSv. Cardiac catheterization: 7–15 mSv. Coronary angioplasty: 15–30 mSv. Complex interventional: 20–100+ mSv. For perspective: annual background radiation is ~3 mSv. These are population averages; individual doses vary widely.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "skineffects", q: "At what dose does radiation necrosis of the skin occur?", a: "Full-thickness skin necrosis (dermal destruction requiring surgical intervention) occurs at doses >15–20 Gy. The tissue becomes non-viable due to vascular destruction. This can occur during complex interventional procedures (e.g., hepatic embolization, coronary CTO procedures) where fluoroscopy times exceed 2 hours.", difficulty: 3 },
  { domain: "skineffects", q: "What is the '2-Gy rule' for skin dose?", a: "2 Gy is considered the practical threshold for observable skin effects. Below 2 Gy: no visible skin injury expected. Above 2 Gy: transient erythema is possible. Facilities should have alert systems that notify the operator when cumulative skin dose approaches 2 Gy.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "qa", q: "What is the purpose of the annual radiation survey by a qualified physicist?", a: "Comprehensive evaluation of all fluoroscopy equipment including: output rate measurements, HVL, collimation accuracy, resolution, dose rate compliance, safety interlock verification, ABC performance, protective equipment integrity, and regulatory compliance. Results are compared to baseline values and regulatory requirements.", difficulty: 1 },
  { domain: "qa", q: "What document specifies the equipment performance standards for fluoroscopy?", a: "Title 21 CFR Part 1020.32 (federal performance standard for fluoroscopic equipment). Additionally: NCRP Report 102 (medical x-ray and gamma-ray protection), NCRP Report 147 (structural shielding design), and state-specific regulations (California Title 17). Manufacturers must certify equipment compliance.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "qa", q: "What is the recommended luminance for soft-copy (monitor) display in fluoroscopy?", a: "Primary diagnostic monitors should have maximum luminance ≥350 cd/m² and luminance ratio ≥250:1. The ambient room lighting should not exceed the luminance equivalent of the darkest displayed level. Monitors should be calibrated to the DICOM Grayscale Standard Display Function (GSDF).", difficulty: 3 },
  { domain: "patientcare", q: "What is the consent process for pediatric patients?", a: "Consent must be obtained from a parent or legal guardian. The child should be given age-appropriate explanation. Assent (agreement) should be sought from children old enough to understand (typically age 7+). In emergencies, treatment can proceed without consent under implied consent doctrine.", difficulty: 1 },
  { domain: "patientcare", q: "What is MRI-compatible contrast and when might it be considered instead of iodinated contrast?", a: "Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are used for MRI, not fluoroscopy. However, if a patient has severe iodinated contrast allergy AND the clinical question can be answered with MRI, switching to MRI with gadolinium may be safer. Note: GBCAs have their own risks including nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in renal patients.", difficulty: 3 },
  { domain: "patientcare", q: "What is the difference between enteral and parenteral contrast administration?", a: "Enteral: contrast given by mouth (oral) or rectum for GI tract visualization — typically barium sulfate or water-soluble contrast. Parenteral: contrast given intravenously or intra-arterially — always iodinated contrast for fluoroscopy. Different risks: enteral → aspiration, perforation leakage. Parenteral → allergic reaction, nephrotoxicity, extravasation.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is dose creep in digital fluoroscopy?", a: "The tendency for radiation doses to gradually increase over time in digital systems because image quality degrades gracefully with lower dose (unlike film, which shows obvious underexposure). Operators may not notice suboptimal dose settings because the system compensates digitally. Regular dose audits prevent dose creep.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "equipment", q: "What is the difference between the tube current (mA) and tube charge (mAs)?", a: "mA = tube current (electrons per second hitting the anode). mAs = tube current × exposure time (total number of electrons = total photons produced). mA determines instantaneous dose rate. mAs determines total dose per frame. In pulsed fluoro, pulse width (ms) × mA = mAs per pulse.", difficulty: 1 },
  { domain: "digital", q: "What is the effect of scattered radiation on digital image quality?", a: "Scatter adds a uniform 'fog' signal to the image, reducing contrast-to-noise ratio. In digital systems, scatter effect can be partially compensated with image processing (contrast enhancement), but the underlying information loss cannot be recovered. Prevention (grids, collimation) is better than post-processing correction.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "digital", q: "What is the quantum sink in a fluoroscopy imaging chain?", a: "The stage in the imaging chain where the fewest information carriers (quanta) exist. This stage limits the overall system performance regardless of how well other stages work. In an II system: usually the output phosphor or lens coupling. In an FPD: the x-ray photons absorbed by the detector (input stage). The quantum sink determines the maximum achievable SNR.", difficulty: 3 },
  { domain: "radprotection", q: "What is the pregnant operator policy for fluoroscopy?", a: "Once a worker declares pregnancy in writing: fetal dose limit is 5 mSv (0.5 rem) total pregnancy, 0.5 mSv/month. The worker must be informed of fetal risks and dose limits. Work restrictions may include: no fluoroscopy operation, or reassignment to low-dose tasks. An additional dosimeter at waist level (under apron) monitors fetal dose.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "radprotection", q: "What is the 'as far as practicable' principle for distance?", a: "Operators should position themselves as far from the radiation source as their duties allow. Standing just 1 foot further from the patient can reduce scatter dose by 20–40%. Use extension tubing for contrast injection. Use remote-control fluoroscopy when available. Every inch of distance matters.", difficulty: 1 },
  { domain: "qa", q: "How is the 5-minute audible timer tested during QC?", a: "Activate fluoroscopy and time the interval until the audible signal sounds using a stopwatch. The timer must sound within ±30 seconds of 5 minutes. Verify the signal is clearly audible from the operator's normal position. Test after any service that might affect the timer circuit.", difficulty: 1 },
  { domain: "qa", q: "What is linearity testing and why is it important?", a: "Testing that the x-ray output is proportional to mAs across all mA stations. Ensures consistent exposure regardless of which mA setting is selected. Tolerance: output/mAs ratios at consecutive mA stations must not differ by more than 10% of their mean. Non-linearity can cause unpredictable exposures.", difficulty: 2 },
  { domain: "skineffects", q: "Why should fluoroscopy time be documented for every procedure?", a: "Fluoroscopy time is a surrogate measure of patient dose. Required by regulation in California and recommended by the ACR. Serves as: (1) a dose metric for the medical record, (2) baseline for comparison with DRLs, (3) trigger for follow-up when thresholds are exceeded, and (4) quality improvement data for tracking operator performance.", difficulty: 1 },
  { domain: "doselimits", q: "What is the penalty for operating x-ray equipment without proper registration in California?", a: "A misdemeanor under the Health and Safety Code. Penalties can include fines and/or imprisonment. The facility supervisor is personally responsible. Equipment must be registered within 30 days of acquisition and renewed every two years (July of even-numbered years).", difficulty: 1 },
