export const CONFUSABLE_PAIRS = [
  { pair: ["Minification gain", "Flux gain"], why: "Both are components of brightness gain but measure different things. Minification = area ratio. Flux = photon ratio." },
  { pair: ["PKA (Gy·cm²)", "Air Kerma (Gy)"], why: "PKA includes field size (stochastic risk). Air kerma alone tells you intensity but not volume irradiated. PKA is constant along beam axis; kerma is not." },
  { pair: ["Deterministic effects", "Stochastic effects"], why: "Deterministic: threshold dose, severity increases with dose (skin burns, cataracts). Stochastic: no threshold, probability increases with dose (cancer, genetic)." },
  { pair: ["Direct ionizing radiation", "Indirect ionizing radiation"], why: "Direct: primary beam. Indirect: secondary radiation (Compton/photoelectric). But indirect ionizing radiation causes direct DNA damage." },
  { pair: ["5 R/min", "10 R/min", "20 R/min"], why: "5 R/min: routine without auto. 10 R/min: routine with auto. 20 R/min: high-level/boost mode maximum." },
  { pair: ["Radiation area", "High radiation area"], why: "Radiation: 0.05 mSv/hr at 30 cm. High: 1 mSv/hr at 30 cm. Factor of 20× difference." },
  { pair: ["Image intensifier distortions", "FPD advantages"], why: "II has pincushion, S distortion, vignetting. FPD has NO spatial distortion but has ghosting, same resolution all FOVs." },
  { pair: ["Fetal monthly limit", "Fetal total limit"], why: "Monthly: 0.5 mSv. Total pregnancy: 5 mSv. Factor of 10×." },
  { pair: ["Somatic effects", "Genetic effects"], why: "Somatic: damage to the individual (skin, cancer, cataracts). Genetic: damage to germ cells passed to offspring." },
  { pair: ["Temporary sterility dose", "Fetal damage threshold"], why: "Temp sterility: 30 rads to spermatogonia. Fetal damage threshold: ≥10 rads (with particular increase ≥15 rads)." },
  { pair: ["ABC (Automatic Brightness Control)", "AGC (Automatic Gain Control)"], why: "ABC adjusts x-ray output (kVp/mA) — controls radiation dose. AGC adjusts video system electronic gain — controls displayed image brightness. Both maintain a 'bright' image but through completely different mechanisms." },
  { pair: ["Direct conversion FPD", "Indirect conversion FPD"], why: "Direct: amorphous selenium converts x-rays directly to charge (no light step). Indirect: CsI scintillator → light → amorphous silicon photodiode → charge. Indirect is more common in fluoroscopy." },
  { pair: ["Photoelectric effect", "Compton scattering"], why: "Photoelectric: complete absorption of photon, dominates at low energies/high Z. Compton: partial absorption + scattered photon, dominates at diagnostic energies in soft tissue. Photoelectric produces NO scatter; Compton is the main source of scatter." },
  { pair: ["Film badge accuracy (±25%)", "TLD accuracy (±9%)"], why: "TLD is 3× more accurate. Film badge provides a permanent physical record. TLD is reusable. Both measure accumulated dose over time; pocket dosimeter gives immediate readout." },
  { pair: ["Characteristic radiation", "Bremsstrahlung radiation"], why: "Characteristic: discrete energies from electron shell transitions. Bremsstrahlung: continuous spectrum from electron deceleration near nuclei. Bremsstrahlung makes up the majority of the diagnostic x-ray beam." },
  { pair: ["High contrast resolution", "Low contrast resolution"], why: "High contrast: thin lines/spaces, copper mesh test, measures spatial detail. Low contrast: large objects with slight density differences, aluminum plate test, measures tissue differentiation. Different tests, different clinical meaning." },
  { pair: ["Deep-dose equivalent (1 cm)", "Eye dose equivalent (0.3 cm)"], why: "Deep dose measured at 1 cm tissue depth for whole-body. Eye dose at 0.3 cm for lens of eye. Different depths because the lens is more superficial. Limits are different: 50 mSv/yr whole body vs 150 mSv/yr eye." },
  { pair: ["CA gonad shielding (0.5 mm Pb)", "Federal gonad shielding (0.25 mm Pb)"], why: "California requires 0.5 mm lead equivalent — double the federal minimum of 0.25 mm. A California-specific regulation that is a common exam question." },
  { pair: ["10-day rule", "14-day rule"], why: "Both relate to scheduling x-rays for women of childbearing age. 10-day (ICRP): exam within 10 days of menses onset. 14-day (NCRP): within 14 days. Current practice: properly indicated exams need not be postponed, but always ask about pregnancy." },
  { pair: ["QA records (3 years)", "Film processor records (1 year)"], why: "QA equipment records must be kept 3 years minimum. Film processor control charts/logs only 1 year. Different retention periods for different types of quality records." },
